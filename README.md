A wrapper of the LÃ–VE2d Framework to represent a game as a set of modular applications. The wrapper is composed of a Global "App", a library with many functions and classes (made a-la-python), and various Modular "Apps".

Each Modular App is implemented using model-view-controller. In the Global App there is an object called application, which is in charge of changing applications and maintaining information from one application to another.

The modular applications were used to make specifically rpg games. But you can implement your own applications that can be anything really and connect them to the system with application.
